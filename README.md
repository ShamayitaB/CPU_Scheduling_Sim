# CPU Scheduling Algorithms Simulator
An interactive web-based simulation tool for visualizing and comparing various CPU scheduling algorithms. Designed for educational purposes, it helps users understand how process scheduling works in operating systems.

## Features

- Interactive simulation of popular scheduling algorithms:
  - First Come First Serve (FCFS)
  - Shortest Job First (SJF)
  - Longest Job First (LJF)
  - Round Robin (RR)
  - Priority Scheduling (Preemptive)
- Input custom process data including:
  - Arrival time
  - Burst time
  - Priority (where applicable)
- Visual Gantt chart display for each algorithm
- Performance metrics:
  - Average waiting time
  - Average turnaround time
  - CPU utilization
- Comparison feature to evaluate algorithm behavior side-by-side
